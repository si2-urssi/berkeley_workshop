# Institute Conceptualization discussion workflow

## Plan

- Pick the strawhorse area that most interests you (development support, incubator, training, policy, community) [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-htwBBOxtHqZjJbjguyEbfXchR7cqg26VA8ym9EANYk/edit?usp=sharing)
- Join the others that have picked the same area at a table. If you have more than 8 people, break into multiple groups that independently discuss the topic.
- Assume an institute will be funded at $5m/year (this is **very** hypothetical)

- Once you have a group please designate a **moderator**, a **note taker**, and a **reporter**.
	- The **moderator** should make sure that everyone has a chance to speak and no one person dominates the discussion. Also please pay attention to the code of conduct.
	-  The **note takers** should take notes in a Google doc with help from everyone in the group.
	-  The **reporter** can be a third person, or can be the same as the moderator or note taker. 
		-  Please create a google doc under your account
		-  Make it writable by anyone with the link
		-  Paste in the link to your doc into this sheet: http://bit.ly/urssi_breakouts

Discussion topic:
Moderator:
Note taker:
Reporter:
Group members:

Please address these topics in your discussion (moderators please make sure that there is enough time to cover all three before the session ends)

1. As a group, divide these funds across the five areas (at a very high level)
2. For your area, how would you allocate your part of the budget? Into what types of activities (still high level, don’t get into the weeds)
3. Who else in the larger community would you want to help you?
4. How would you further plan your area?
5. And finally, what would you change about the strawhorse?
6. What are the cross-cutting issues in your area?

```

## Reporting out

- **Reporters** should be prepared to summarize the main points of the group discussion, including the five topics, after the breakout (5 minutes/group)
